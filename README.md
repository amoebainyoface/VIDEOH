Project Name: <br>
<i>Abu Dhabi/ Tales from Abu Dhabi</i>

Project Description:<br>
The project is an interactive map, a sort of prototype to what we hope to be a video archive of the stories that fill Abu Dhabi. The idea of a map that not only points to a location but also speaks about the demographic and the existence of people that populate it. Our main video featuring an afro barbershop next to a mosque in the city elaborates upon this idea.


Process:<br>
During the ideation of what video to shoot, Hamad came up with the idea of the barbershop next to the mosque he always visit. The barbershop primarily Caribbean plays a lot of afro-beats while they go about their business. However, as a sign of respect and peaceful co-existence they stop this music to people pray undisturbed when the prayer calls begin at the mosque. Building upon this idea, I decided that we should go for a map interface showing all different nuances that a multicultural and developing city Abu Dhabi is turning into, from the mosque to our university and even a throwback to the creepy red desert! <br>

I worked on the video shoot and video editing with Hamad first after which we decided to figure out the map interface. I went with the illustrator route using SVGs for which Nafiha created amazing icons of the city. Luka pretty much consolidated the interactivity of the website using CSS and javascript. <br>

For video editing, we went with the principal of an observational documentary: one of the key tenets of <i>Cinema Vérité </i>(Truthful Cinema) which doesn’t rely on narration or a netflix level production but a more grounded and true, fly on the wall depiction of life in the city.  We found this very important as the students of film, we invite the viewer to find out more about the place and be active rather than depict a subject in a fictionalised narrative sense which is much criticised in more orthodox documentaries with narrators.<br>


Reflection/Evaluation:<br>

The project was a brief experimentation tackling with much bigger ideas of representation and the people in the city. I personally still strongly defend my stance on no narration as it defeats the purpose of visible truth in turn for some added sense of narrative spoon-feed to viewers. I would definitely change the placeholder video of the nyu promo video for a more nuanced depiction of students and workers here in Saadiyat. I also think we did an amazing job with the interaction with our documentary subject and did not sacrifice the ethics of ethnographic filmmaking for narrative.
